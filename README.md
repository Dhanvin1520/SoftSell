# 🧾 SoftSell – Software License Resale Landing Page

Hey there! 👋  I am dhanvin vadlamudi
The task was to build a **responsive, 1-page marketing website** for a fictional company called **SoftSell** — a platform for reselling unused software licenses.  

I approached this like a real-world freelance/portfolio project as i have experience in freelancing  with clean UI, fast load speed, and great mobile responsiveness in mind.
